I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.

Step to execute:
python DecisionTree.py <training-set> <test-set> <Stopwords.txt>


Example: python NaiveBayes.py train test Stopwords.txt
